			    I was a participant for the science and training wokrshop, IITM, Pune. It is a famous place for its managed landsclape, presence of universities and governments investment in information and technology. During the training workshop we learned on the regional downscaling approach, and I was able sot share my experience of hydrological modelling,

              It was already late in the evening, and therefore we were not able to go inside the palace but this was really beautiful. Actually, the Red Fort Complex is the UNESCO heritage site, that was built as the palace fort Shan Jahan.The lighting in the evening was mesmerizing, we just watched it and stayed for nearly two hours praising the elegance of artificial lights and historical monuments. It is near to Old Delhi, and one of the memorable place that I have been.

               <a class="break-long-url" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal">   Nepal</a> is rich in diversity of plants, animals, socio-cultural practices. There is altitude gradient from about 500masl to 8848 masl, within an span of 150 to 250 kilometers (from South to North). Likewise, within an span of about 880 kilometers there is diversity in the landscape, ecology, socio-cultural attributes and livelihood style (from East to West).

              This year, was full of experiences and learnings. Travelled to different parts of Nepal and India, and explored about the climate change, data analysis, hydrological modelling in more details. Participanted in some of the social event, and meet with the interesting people.

              Year 2017 was all about field visits. I travlled to different parts of Nepal, for supporting the governmental policy in preparation of the community based adaptation practices. Travelled to Karnali watershed for understanding the aquatic biodiversity (especially macroinvertebrates) and exploring the impact of climate change and developmental activities

              The visit to Karnali watershed was really interesting and inspiring for me because I was supporting in the field visit for my teacher, who had taught me during my school days. Its great feeling to be connected with the teachers who had highlighted the significance of scientific research  during my school days. Those act of generating/supporting curiosity has played vital role in me for working in the research sector.

            Community are the source of knowledge.  To hear the local voices, highlight their opinions, and encourage the government to prioritize them in the plan of action was challenging yet it was fun and informative. It was also intersting task to properly digitize/arrange the data in an effective way so that the required information could be extracted efficiently and the authorities/stakeholders can quickly get what they are searching for. <br>
			      The hard work in the field is refreshed by the beautiful landscape, healthy food, cultural identity and hospitality of the local people. <br>
