Currently I am going through R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. I am also taking the bits and pieces of the Johns Hopkins University Courses on R programming.

			  The figure on the left is from Pahupati area, its a regligios place for HIndus. Many people from Nepal and India visit this place to pray. The location from where photo is taken is ideal place for having a cup of coffee and wathing the flow of people. Oh by the way there is the Baghmati river near to this temple which used to sustain whole Kathmandu people but now the model shows most of the poepel are enjoying the deep ground water. 
			  Likewise, the second image is from the Lalitpur area, I was hiking in that place on January. The landscape of the place is quite beautiful. This image reflects the livelihood style, housing pattern, topography of the place. <br>

              Oh! I had nearly forgot about the training we had that have paved out the path for the activities for the year 2020. The training was more focused on understanding the capabilities of our partners and where we could support them to stregth/empower them. This training has paved a way for the impoving the data management and analysis of our partner organizaiton. We are working if it can happen online, during the program I will be mostly focusing on the data analysis approaches, use of R, and hydrological modelling tools for the water resouce management.
