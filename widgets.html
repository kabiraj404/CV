            Till now this year 2020 has been mostly the desk-based work, so far. <br>
			With extra saved hours for not having to commute. I am learning the data science. I would say, this enthusiasm has bought me here in preparation of this website. Currently I am going through R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. I am also taking the bits and pieces of the Johns Hopkins University Courses on R programming.

There is the <a class="break-long-url" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagmati_River">Baghmati river  </a> near to this temple (not clearly visible in this photo). Kathmandu valley lies in the Baghmanti river basin and besides providing water to the valley, it has both the religios and cultural significance. Likewise, the second image is from the Lalitpur area, I was hiking on that area on January. The landscape is surreal and ideal place for the short hike during the weekends. I love this photograph because it reflects the livelihood style, housing pattern, topography of the place.

              Oh! I had nearly forgot about the workshop we had on February, that paved the path for the activities for the year 2020. The training was more focused on understanding the capabilities of our partners and where we could support them to strength/empower them. The collaborative understanding highlighted the need for improving the data management and support in the analysis. The different variable especially this pandemic will reflect how it will unravel in the future( as of June 2020). We are working on the possibilities of  online program. I will be mostly focusing on the data analysis approaches, use of R, GIS and hydrological modelling tools for the water resource management, therefore fearing that the online will not be as effective as in person. But lets see. Hope the curve gets flatten fast.

              For most part of the year I had been working for this book. I am one of the author of the first chapter: Conceptual understanding of river basin drivers and their implications for Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM). It lays the foundation of the concept of the IRBM and highlights the significance for the better understanding of river systems.   <br> 
			  While working for the book, it was a awesome experience collaborating with the different experts. As I was coordinating with the different authors for the different modules, I was able to understand the holistic behavior of the river basin. Along with consultation of the experts from ICIMOD we were also able to get the input/review from the external experts who had been working in the same topic for years was really helpful for in-depth understanding and increment of my knowledge.

              To continue the institutional capacity building, the participants learned about the concept and different aspects of climate change, downscaling of the Global Climate Models, and evaluated the future change in temperature and precipitation patterns. This approach of understanding was better for understanding the water resource management. This enabled to better understand the climate change scenarios, impact of climate change on future hydrology and components of the hydrological regime..

              This year provided me ample opportunities to lean and share the information that I had. During the fourth international conference on "Mountains in the changing world", October 2019, I presented about the Karnali River Basin of western Nepal, highlighted the need of the detailed analysis on the future scenario and its significance for the water resource management. It was appreciated by the particpants and a fruitful discussion.

Those curiosity has played vital part for me working in the research sector.

              Community are the source of knowledge. Interacting about their local challenges and the mitigating approach and what/how government policy can support. To hear the local voices, prioritize it and encourage the government to put in them in the plan of action is really challenging but it was fun too. (1 of 4). <br> 
			  Understanding the field reality is one part another part is how to properly digitize/arrange it in efficient way. I remember sitting together until for the  late hours with my friends to manage the information (2 of 4). <br> 
			  Each piece of information is important and we try not to miss it. We were on the field, we were taking the physio-chemical properties of water, we took the photos and even wrote it in paper so that we do not miss or loss any information (3 of 4). <br> 
			  The hard work in the field is refreshed by the beautiful landscape, healthy food, cultural identity (4 of 4) <br>
