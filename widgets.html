             This page is more about reflecting my activities while I am not starring at my computer screen. Lets start with my interest. I am interested in -- Hiking and cycling; -- Watching movies (my recent favorite are: Uncut Gems (2019) and Good Time (2017) by Josh Safdie and Benny Safdie); -- Reading books (currently reading: 21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari and The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins); -- Sketching (but don't know how to draw a straight line :));  -- Learning Morse code (it seems interesting,  but I'm still in infancy and trying to remember ._ _... _._. _..)  <br>
			 In the following section, I will be reflecting my recent years in around four/five photos. <br>

              Oh! I had nearly forgot about the workshop we had on February with our partner. The workshop was more focused on understanding the capabilities and areas to strength/empower. The collaborative understanding highlighted the need for improving the data management and support in the analysis. The different variable especially the duration of this pandemic will reflect how it will unravel in the future( as of June 2020). During the future event, <span class="highlight-text"> I will be mostly sharing on the data analysis approaches, use of R, GIS and hydrological modelling tools for the water resource management </span> , therefore fearing that the online will not be as effective as in person.

			  Understanding the field reality is one dimention, another dimention is how to properly digitize/arrange the data in effective way so that the required information could be extracted efficiently and the authorities/stakeholders can quickly get what they are searching for. I remember sitting together for the  late hours, with my friends to manage these vital data (Photo:2 of 4). <br> 
			  We tried not to miss a single piece of data/information, as each word mattered. While we were on the field, we tried to make sure that we have saved the information in multiple formats, making sure we do not loose any small pieces. For example, we were taking the physio-chemical properties of water, we took the photos and also wrote it in paper, so that we do not miss or loss any information (Photo:3 of 4). <br>
